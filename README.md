# MNIST Digit Classification using CNN

This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implementation for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The model achieves high accuracy on the test set, demonstrating its effectiveness for digit recognition tasks.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create and train a CNN to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset, which consists of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of digits (0-9).

## Files

- `mnist_cnn.py`: Python script containing the CNN model implementation, training, and evaluation.
- `README.md`: This file.
